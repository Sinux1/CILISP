## CiLisp
### Summary
#### Task 1 ::= CPN Calculator  
In this task, I first extended the `ciLisp.l` file to define a DOUBLE and completed the definition for FUNC.  

Summarize what has been done so far. Specify which tasks have been completed so far.
### Sample Runs
Sample runs should all come from the most recent implementation. Sample runs which were done to test previous tasks should be done again with the new implementation.
You'll save a lot of time here if you save all of your test inputs for each task in the inputs folder and keep them organized!
Sample runs should be organized by task; there should be sample runs showing that everything in task 1 still works in the up-to-date implementation, and so on up through the most recent task.
### Known Bugs
If anything is not functioning to specification, you are responsible enough for testing enough to recognize that this is the case and fix it. If you give up on fixing something, you are required to list it here.
Bugs which are discovered by the grader but not listed here will be graded harshly. Bugs which are listed here will be graded nicely, within reason.
Known bugs should also be organized by task, and should be well-described.
Lazy bug descriptions which don't go into detail about what is going wrong ("<functionality> doesn't work", "<feature> throws an error") will be graded as if the bug was not listed here.
This includes bugs that were created in functionality from prior tasks. If your task 5 breaks your task 3, we will check your task 3 submission if the bug is noted here, but if it is not noted here then we will assume that task 3 never worked and grade accordingly.
